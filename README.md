# Lancer
Lancer is a ported version of [warp.py](https://github.com/devunt/warp) written by devunt. It works under .NET Framework 4.5 instead of Python and gevent.

### HTTPS
Lancer supports HTTPS, now.

### FTP
I'm sorry there is no FTP support :/

### Howto
Just run it. It will show a black command window.

Go to Internet Option, Connections, click LAN settings, check the proxy server, type 'localhost' (127.0.0.1 or [::1] also works) for the address and 8080 for the port.

That's it. Now It Just Works.

### Command
lancer [/host IPADDRESS] [/port PORTNUMBER]

### Is it perfect?
NO. I hope so but it isn't. I'll appreciate all the code contribution for the perfection :D
